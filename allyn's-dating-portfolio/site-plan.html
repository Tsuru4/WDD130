        Wireframes
      </h2>
      <p>
        Create three wireframes for your site. One for each page and list them here</p>

      <h3>Home</h3>
      <p>         
        The audience for this site will be very narrow, limited to women who may have seen my dating profile and want more information without needing to commit to anything.
         A typical dating app has many limitations, such as a limit on the amount of pictures and introductoty info, requiring the audience to create an account, and no way to investigate further without committing with a "swipe up".
         This main page should cover that flaw by providing a more comprehensive introduction. On the other hand, it is important to keep this page relatively simple, to avoid overwhelming the audience. It should introduce single girls to me,
         making a good first impression and inviting girls to learn more.
      </p>
      <img src="#" alt="home page wireframe">

      <h3>More About Allyn</h3>
      <p>         
        This page holds content which goes beyond the scope of a mere introduction, making it similar to a FAQ. Any minor details that are frequently asked should be addressed here.
         In other words, the purpose of this page is to keep the main page simple and focused, preventing visitors from being overwhelmed by an information overload. Anything a girl would not care about on first impression,
         but may want to know before agreeing to a date should be here. IE, this is the where I can go into details about my interests, life goals, my personal strengths and weaknesses. 
         This page is meant to overcome a huge obstacle of dating apps, which is the lack of details alllowed on a typical profile page. This page should disclose any information I am willing to make public. It should be relatively concise and carefully organized
         so that the audience can quickly skim through and find topics she is interested in. This page will cover a lot of topics about my personal life, so easy navigation will be crucial.
         I want the audience to quickly spot any common interests without being detered over overwhelmed by anything that she does not relate to. As such, the website should be designed in a way that any uninteresting information should be easily glossed over.
      </p>
      <img src="#" alt="page 2 wireframe">

      <h3>Requirements</h3>
      <p>         
        This page will be the smallest. It will focus on what I am looking for, that way if the viewer is interested but isn't my type, she doesn't need to waste her time reaching out to me. Kind of like the requirements and qualifications section on a job post.
         This page should be relatively small, because I'm don't want to be too picky on a dating portfolio; I'm just trying to eliminate major red flags such as the veiwer having irreconcilable values or lifestyles, without tearing down their self confidence.
          At the same time, I want to boost the confidence of viewers who do fit my standards.
